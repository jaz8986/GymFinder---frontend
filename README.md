# GymFinder
[Video Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0cUdAfFrwc)

## Description
### Current State
Currently gym’s are manually added to the database and gym memberships can be added and edited from there. 
### Future Plans
Ideally I’d like to have it identify the users current location and search for gyms around the area.

## Installation
Clone down repo then run:
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
